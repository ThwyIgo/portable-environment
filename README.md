# What is this repo about?
I've been using a lot of public PCs recently and I don't have root access to them.  
The objective is to download my config files and install any software I need on any PC without root or administrator privileges.  
I want to make everything in POSIX sh (I currently depend on bash) and maybe support Windows and MacOS in the future.

# Usage
Download "install.sh" and run it.

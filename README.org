* Why this repo exists?
I've been using a lot of public PCs recently and I don't have root access to
them. The goal is to download my dotfiles and install any software I need on any
PC without root privileges.

I want to make everything in POSIX sh and maybe support Windows and MacOS in the
future.

* Usage
Run =install.sh=
